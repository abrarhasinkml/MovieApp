A movie searching application created using React-Native.
It is expected that you have the following versions are installed: Node: v14.16.1+, npm: 6.14.12 & react-native: 0.64.0

The movie app greets users with a search screen where users can search for any movie in the OMDb database. The application returns a list of movies matching the search query. Upon clicking on the title of the movie, users are redirected to a new page where they can view further details of the movie (ie. title, cast, director, genre, poster etc.)


The OMDb API has been used for this project: http://www.omdbapi.com/
